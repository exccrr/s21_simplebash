As I open my eyes, I am grateful for this moment of tranquility. 
The beauty of the surroundings and the peacefulness of the stream have rejuvenated 
my spirit and filled me with a renewed sense of energy. 
I take one last look at the breathtaking landscape before continuing on my journey, 
carrying the serenity of this place with me.
